# Project README

## Overview

This project is a simple sign-in form implementation with JavaScript validation. The project includes a sign-in form where users can enter their username and password. The provided JavaScript code validates the entered credentials, and if correct, it redirects the user to a fictional portfolio page (`portfolio.html`). The project also includes basic styling using CSS.

## Implementation

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the sign-in form and linking to the necessary styles and scripts.
- `signin.css`: The CSS file providing styles for the sign-in form.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for validating user credentials and managing sign-in attempts.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the sign-in form.
2. Enter the provided username (`user`) and password (`password`) for a successful sign-in attempt.
3. Upon successful sign-in, you will be redirected to a fictional portfolio page.
4. The form allows a maximum of 5 sign-in attempts. After exceeding this limit, the form becomes disabled.

Feel free to customize the project according to your needs, such as adding more features, improving styling, or integrating with a server for user authentication.
